SITE DESCRIPTION


I designed and built PeakLAB for two specific reasons. First to educate my client/users, and secondly to create business awareness,  within potentials offered by ORM and DOM interactions. The backbone of the idea was centered on giving clients and users, a simple platform to really understand the impact their inputs could have in a well structured Data System.  The site helps possible clients appreciate the true value of user inputs.  That should be the real and full focus of any productive business seeking to maximize true profitability, which overall should be reflected by the growth of their company.  A company is only as good and strong as the people's interests and or involvement in the company they are a part of. This principle of integrity and bonding amongst producer/consumer, represents the vital link of trust and confidence, required in healthy growth cycles of consumption for a service and or product produced. 

The dynamic section offers a fully guided USER Potential Tour experience, with the main  purpose of creating an aggregate value to "consumer/producer" relations.  

The site demonstrates the utility and resourcefulness of data collection and automated analysis. It is divided in sections pertaining to the user/client interests, and every interaction or added value from the user will return diferent flow patterns. With more than 9 million permutations in the initial part of the dynamic grid, the user will later have the option for further more advanced testing or " interactive experience", which overall will return one unique result within the total amount of different results available, which are beyond a trillion in count.

Per example if you choose the circle in the dynamic part and add up motion to the clicks, you will receive diferent results to those which you could have received if any other control option had dominated. Running on Javascript and Mysql, the site can gather dynamic information and return positive values, as the user/client participates in the several testing areas.
